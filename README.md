# ajax-contact-form
AJAX Contact Form Solution for any website, including Wordpress, crafted with some neat and safe beginner-level code. &lt;3

This repository is intended to provide developers with a light and plugin-free solution for handling user contact messages sent through a website. It includes:
- a template HTML form, with the classes and ids used in its respective JS script;
- jQuery version of the script which collects, treats and sends user input to the server side, displaying any alerts needed;
- native JS version of the script described right above;
- PHP script which collects and validates user input, then e-mails both the website admin and the user, responding to the AJAX request with a success or failure code.
